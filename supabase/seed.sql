-- Create a test user (password: password)
-- NOTE: In local development, you often need to create users via Auth API or Studio.
-- But we can insert into auth.users if we are superuser, though it's tricky with encryption.
-- Better to just insert some public data if needed.

-- For now, let's just insert some global configs or non-user data if any.
-- Since our app is user-centric, seed data usually requires a user ID.
-- We will leave this empty for now, but the file exists for future use.
